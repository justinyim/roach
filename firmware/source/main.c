 * ImageProc2.5 Main Loop
 * 'roach' project for Biomimetics Millisystesm Lab
 *
 * This is the main entry point for the 'roach' project, targeting the
 * ImageProc2.5 board and applications with VelociRoACH robots.
 *
 * This code calls to imageproc-lib to do chip, clock, and board setup.
 * After that, module setup functions are called.
 * Finally, the main loop is entered, where low-priority queues are serviced.
 * 
 * Note that a large amount of UART, radio, and cmd module code has crept into 
 * this main loop implementation.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   For minimal startup requirements, see 'imageproc-basic':
 *   https://github.com/biomimetics/imageproc-basic
